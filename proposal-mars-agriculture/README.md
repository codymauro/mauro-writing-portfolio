## Mars Agriculture Systems Proposal  

**What:** Technical proposal for theoretical Mars-based agricultural infrastructure, synthesizing aerospace engineering, life support systems, and planetary science research into a structured proposal document with technical specifications, feasibility analysis, and implementation frameworks.<br><br>
**Why:** Shows ability to research and synthesize complex technical domains, produce formal proposal documentation, and communicate specialized scientific concepts to mixed technical and non-technical audiences—directly relevant to aerospace, defense, and research-oriented technical writing roles.<br><br>
**Audience:** Research program managers, aerospace engineering teams, planetary science researchers, and funding decision-makers evaluating feasibility of long-duration Mars missions.<br><br>
**Tools Used:** Research synthesis methodologies, technical specification documentation, proposal writing frameworks, scientific citation standards.<br>
